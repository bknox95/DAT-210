/*Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both doubles) as input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

        Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
        System.out.printf("%.2f", yourValue);

        The output ends with a newline.

        Ex: If the input is:

        20.0 3.1599
        the output is:

        3.16 11.85 79.00
        Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation. */
